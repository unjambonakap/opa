Welcome to the plll lattice reduction library!

This is the first public release of the library. While algorithms such as LLL, BKZ,
Kannan-Schnorr-Euchner enumeration and Deep Insertions are heavily tested, other algorithms and
settings might not be correct or have other kind of problems.

If you encounter problems, please provide feedback to felix@fontein.de. You can always find the
newest version under https://felix.fontein.de/plll/. If you are interested in working on this
library, please also contact me under felix@fontein.de.
