plll/include/plll/matrix-ops2.hpp:
    Add support for some "compatibility move" support for C++98. Maybe also something like 
    destructive_move (http://isocpp.org/files/papers/n4034.pdf).

plll/include/plll/arithmetic.hpp:
    Add support for unicode strings (wchar_t-based in C++98, and new character types in
    C++11, as well as new strings in C++11).

plll/src/arithmetic/ddqd-wrapper.cpp:
    Add proper conversions between dd_real and qq_real on the one side, and long int, 
    long long, mpfr_t and mpz_t on the other hand.

plll/src/arithmetic/primes.cpp:
    Implement a more efficient prime sieve, such as 
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin


General:
  - add more comments!
  - extend documentation, in particular the example section
  - add more support for C++11/14
  - improve support for less mainstream algorithms by test them thoroughly
